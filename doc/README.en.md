Awb works with your self-control with the pre-commitment strategy; If the soul is like a baby, as Imam Al-Busairi -may God have mercy on him- said:
 
> The soul is like a baby, if you neglect him, he will grow in love with breastfeeding, and if you wean him, he will be weaned

Then one of the ways of weaning that baby is self-control by pre-commitment strategy, the most famous example of it is the story [Ulysses and the Sirens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_and_the_Sirens_(Waterhouse)); Therefore, Awb contracts with you a contract of self-control for a period that you specify and applications you choose, and upon the expiration of that period, you can use all the applications installed on your phone Normally.

### Features

- Lockout the phone for some time (from 1s to ~25h).
- Use a **minimal launcher** that allows only useful apps during the detoxing period while locking other time-wasting apps.
- Impossible to break the lock even if you restart the phone :wink:.
- Lightweight, fast and minimal.
- Free (as in freedom) and Open Source app.
- NO Ads.
- NO ANY form of data collection. Check it out! It's open-source.
- FREE.

## Installation

Download the APK from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mohamed-sallam/awb-android/releases/) and install it.

There is no version available on Google Play Store or F-Droid yet.

> **Note**
> 
>Awb will ask you for two permissions when you first launch it, so you must allow them. It will also ask you for another permission every time you turn the lock on, so allow that too.
